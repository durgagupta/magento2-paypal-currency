# magento2-paypal-currency

This extension allow us to do pay-pal payment with using custom currency and rate

We can do pay-pal payment in magento2 if we have base currency except currency allowed by pay-pal.

for example i have my base currency in NPR. where as pay-pal doesn't allow NRP so we need to do USD in this extension we can set Currency and conversion rate to base currency.
